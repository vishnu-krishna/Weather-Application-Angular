# This is a Weather Application which uses angular to fetch the data from Openweathermap.org using an API key and displays the weather for the location and the days which we mention.
Technologies Used:

*HTML
*CSS
*Javascript
*Jquery
*Angular JS
*Angular Routing
*Angular Resource

I have posted this in github pages but currently this is not working as it has multiple pages( only the index.html page works)

For seeing it in action, please download it from github and open the index.html page.
This was completed in exactly 3.5 hours.

Im expecting to see more things to be done if i had more time
1. Add Animations using ngAnimate
2. Make it look more User Friendly
3. Add Validation to the submit button and also validation for the inputs
